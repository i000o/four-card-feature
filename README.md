## Overview

This challenge is to create a four-card feature page for both mobile and desktop. The page includes a header, with a 3-column layout, where cards are aligned at different positions creating a plus-like cross on the page.

## The task

This design needs to be responsive.

## Approach

I approached this with a mobile-first workflow to practice this some more. I initially began with a Flexbox 3-column layout, <!-- Finish this line -->

## My process

- I did download Sass as a pre-processor, but I haven't yet used it.
- I started with a mobile first approach to practice this workflow as I've tended to be more comfortable with the desktop-first workflow previously.
- I wrote down and planned on paper a little the HTML elements I could see/would use. I decided to plan a Flexbox layout with CSS since I had recently practiced this on a deeper level and felt more confident - I wanted to apply this into a project.
- I initialised a new git repository with ease this time!
- I was able to implement the `order` property for the first time for the mobile version. Since I had planned my 3-column flex layout, each card had a left-to-right order in the HTML until I was able to rearrange it in the CSS for mobile. This was really satisfying and so useful to be able to depend on now.
- I'm getting better at linking images quickly.
- I finished the mobile so much faster than I thought I would - I was proud. It looked good and I did it quite efficiently.
- I did 425px first - Was this a mistake?
- I think the margins are too narrow on mine
- Sass! I installed Sass syntax highlighting and the compiler to try Sass with this CSS file. I can create modules, nesting and variables to help sustian my code better.
- I learnt new Git commands:

- - To remove a github repo file if you didn’t add it to the gitignore at the beginning.

```
git rm —cached file-name
git commit -m “removed file-name”
git push
```

- - This removes it from the repo but not locally. If you want to remove it altogether, use:

```
git rm file-name
```

- - If you did that by accident, use:

```
git checkout HEAD — filename
```

I used the order property for the first time and succeeded! At first, it wasn't targetting correctly, but I cleaned up my HTML with more specific elements and then it worked so simple aaaah so happy what a useful tool
