## Overview

This challenge is to create a four-card feature page for both mobile and desktop. The page includes a header, with a 3-column layout, where cards are aligned at different positions creating a plus-like cross on the page.

### The challenge

This design needs to be responsive.

## My process

- I did download Sass as a pre-processor, but I haven't yet used it.
- I started with a mobile first approach to practice this workflow as I've tended to be more comfortable with the desktop-first workflow previously.
- I wrote down and planned on paper a little the HTML elements I could see/would use. I decided to plan a Flexbox layout with CSS since I had recently practiced this on a deeper level and felt more confident - I wanted to apply this into a project.
- I initialised a new git repository with ease this time!
- I was able to implement the `order` property for the first time for the mobile version. Since I had planned my 3-column flex layout, each card had a left-to-right order in the HTML until I was able to rearrange it in the CSS for mobile. This was really satisfying and so useful to be able to depend on now.
- I'm getting better at linking images quickly.
- I finished the mobile so much faster than I thought I would - I was proud. It looked good and I did it quite efficiently.
- I did 425px first - Was this a mistake?
- I think the margins are too narrow on mine

### Time taken

- Mobile: 3 hrs

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

I used the order property for the first time and succeeded! At first, it wasn't targetting correctly, but I cleaned up my HTML with more specific elements and then it worked so simple aaaah so happy what a useful tool
